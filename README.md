# <Project Richard Saplaco - Password Generator>

## Description

Utilizing available resources to meet the acceptance criteria, I am glad to present to you this Password Generator whilst still learning my javascript and slowly gathering enough knowledge to be able to understand the codes and what it does.

Upon clicking the generate password button, the user will be asked for the lenght of the password, if it meets the required lenght, the user will be successively asked of the different character sets (e.g. lowercase, number) that the user wants to include in the password and a validation will appear if the user has chosen atleast one, and upon that input will it generate a new password based on the selected characters. Be reminded that an alert will appear if it does not meet the required password lenght and if none of the 4 character set is chosen and will trigger to go back to start.
